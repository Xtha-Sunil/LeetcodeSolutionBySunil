In this repo I will upload leetcode solution.
</br> All code in this repo are my approach, which  may/may not be optimal solution for the problem.

</br> </br>
If you want to try specific problem then you can do `https://leetcode.com/problems/<filename>`.

</br>
`filename` without extension. 

# Example
If filename is `two-sum.java` then `https://leetcode/problems/two-sum` will take you to that specific problem.
